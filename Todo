TODO list for Perl module WWW::Patent::Page

-add Open Patent Service module

-make a PDF (image + text) object to allow text-searching and image printout

-POE compatibility and utility:  write helper methods for fetching things 
like multiple tiff images, pdf single pages, gifs, in parallel and then 
continuing when all are assembled.

-make this work with accessors instead of accessing variables directly

-be more neat about LWP::UserAgent; have a better means of storing data in object

-rewrite the use of LWP $self->request( HTTP::Request-object ) to a method
that makes repeated requests if proxy can not contact the website, 
deals with certain errors, and can use as 
method either an LWP or POE request to avoid blocking.

-change to model of "die"ing (dying) with confess of Carp.pm, rewrite examples in 
if eval( ) {} else { print $@ } form. 

-make loading of Page/office.pm optional on use of office

- there seems to be a bug in at least MICROPATENT_pdf where the fetching
is not successful, but a HTTP::Response object is not returned so that the
->is_success method is not available, which is a fatal error. 

- the interpretation of doc_id should probably be a function of office;
	since ESPACE and USPTO do it different for plant and such
- more error reporting, when patent retrieval is refused by office
