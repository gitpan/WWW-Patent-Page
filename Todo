TODO list for Perl module WWW::Patent::Page

- More tests
- More functionality; make use of the two letter country codes
- More offices
- read enthusiastic emails from users and bug-reporters
- release early and often, in response to bug-reporters
- cache and reuse the URL that most directly retrieves the page, rather than rebuilding it each time.
