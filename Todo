TODO list for Perl module WWW::Patent::Page


- there seems to be a bug in at least MICROPATENT_pdf where the fetching
is not successful, but a HTTP::Response object is not returned so that the
->is_success method is not available, which is a fatal error. 

- the interpretation of doc_id should probably be a function of office;
	since ESPACE and USPTO do it different for plant and such
- more error reporting, when patent retrieval is refused by office
