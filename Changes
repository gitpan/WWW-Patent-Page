	-added test that diagnosed correction immediately above

0.102.0 finished August 2007
	-polled micropatent pdf to give time to get the stuff ready 
	-added a new "document" type to MICROPATENT, called "data" (versus "pdf", "html", etc.) from the "worksheet" they provide, that delivers a hash of data about the patent (inventors, assignee, citations, claims, etc.) 
	-increased File::Temp version to 0.17 to account for ->seek method 
	-returned HTTP::Response -like objects in various places where they should be... whoops 
	
0.101.0 finished Aug 2007
	-commented out two "close" statements on File::Temp objects in USPTO_pdf method of USPTO class; I think these could be closed after the files are accessed, but going for minimal changes.  This may make a memory leak, so let me know.
	-improved critic test in looking for TEST_AUTHOR
	
0.100.0 finished Feb 2007
	-three part release number requires installing "version.pm" distribution (sorry about that...)
	-rewrote the parser of "patent numbers"- method 'parse_doc_id'
	-changed some tests to be consistent with parser, which now leaves the doc_id alone and parses into separate values like country, kind, type
	-added further testing of patent number parser
	-added Perl::Critic testing (with some exclusions, and only used when you are me )
	-added test of network accessibility (basically for firewalls)
	-got rid of some warnings that wrote over testing
	-made pod testing conditional on being me- so others will not need to add modules for testing
	-added many two-letter country codes

	TODO -  use HTTP::Response, better use of "is_success" and "message", more tests
	 Longer range:  Add modules for machine translations from Japan and Korea
	 timing of patent retrieval from various offices
	 test coverage

0.09 (beginning Nov 14) tried to account for Micropatent javascript that refreshes document delivery page until document is delivered.
    Did not add a test for this condition, as the condition (slowness) depends on MicroPatent website.
	Accounted for it by repeatedly clicking the "Click Here for Current Status of Order" form, assumed to be the first form on the page.

0.08 removed extraneous print statements

0.07 changed tests for MicroPatent to skip if username and password not supplied
  put in a longer timeout for LWP::UserAgent to allow for slow patent offices

0.06 added MICROPATENT.pm to use that source: pdf, xml, html

	USPTO changed their interface: H1,523 is out, H001,523 is in!
